# -Exams-Schedule-Generator-Using-Genetic-Algorithm
A Python tool that generates optimized exam schedules using a custom Genetic Algorithm. It enforces hard constraints (no overlap, weekday exams, invigilator availability) and optimizes soft ones. Techniques include roulette wheel selection, mutation, and crossover. Outputs a tabular timetable with fitness scores, ideal for universities.
